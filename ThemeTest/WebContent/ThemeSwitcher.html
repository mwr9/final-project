		<strong>Sir Āpirana Turupa Ngata</strong> (3 July 1874 – 14 July 1950)
		was a prominent New Zealand politician and lawyer. He has often been
		described as the foremost Māori politician to have ever served in
		Parliament, and is also known for his work in promoting and protecting
		Māori culture and language.

	<div id="dialog" title="Basic dialog">
		<p>One of 15 children, Ngata was born in Te Araroa (then called
			Kawakawa), a small coastal town about 175 kilometres north of
			Gisborne, New Zealand.[1] His iwi was Ngāti Porou. His father was
			Paratene Ngata, a tribal leader and expert in traditional lore, and
			his mother was Katerina Naki, the daughter of an itinerant Scot, Abel
			Knox.[2] Ngata was greatly influenced both by his father and by his
			great-uncle Ropata Wahawaha (who had led loyal kupapa Ngāti Porou
			forces against their Pai Mārire enemy (commonly known as Hauhau) in
			the East Cape War and later Te Kooti's escapees from the Chatham
			Islands.)[3] Ngata was raised in a Māori environment, speaking the
			Māori language, but his father also ensured that Ngata learned about
			the Pākehā world, believing that this understanding would be of
			benefit to Ngāti Porou.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Ngata attended primary school in Waiomatatini before moving on
		to Te Aute College, where he received a Pākehā-style education. Ngata
		performed well, and his academic results were enough to win him a
		scholarship to Canterbury University College (now the University of
		Canterbury), where he studied political science and law. He gained a
		BA in politics in 1893, the first Māori to complete a degree at a New
		Zealand university, then gained an LL.B. at the University of Auckland
		in 1896 (the first New Zealander, Māori or Pakeha, to gain a double
		degree).[4]</p>

	</h2>
	<p>In 1895, a year before finishing his second degree (law), Ngata
		married 16-year-old Arihia Kane Tamati who was also of the Ngāti Porou
		iwi. Ngata had previously been engaged to Arihia's elder sister, Te
		Rina, but she died. Apirana and Arihia had eleven children; six girls
		and five boys.[1]</p>
	<p>Shortly after Ngata's legal qualifications were recognised, he
		and his wife returned to Waiomatatini where they built a house. Ngata
		quickly became prominent in the community, making a number of efforts
		to improve the social and economic conditions of Māori across the
		country. He also wrote extensively on the place of Māori culture in
		the modern age. At the same time, he gradually acquired a leadership
		role within Ngāti Porou, particularly in the area of land management
		and finance.</p>
